# Justin Johnson GES Final Project 


## **This is a porfolio of zoning maps created to showcase my final project in GES 687.** 

___

### Purpose of Project 

The purpose of this project was to measure the effects that single-family zoning has on community characteristics in the Baltimore Metropolitan Statistical Region (BMSA), also known as Central Maryland. 

___

### Data 
Getting data for this project consisted of taking data on detailed zoning maps as well as community demographics for individual census tracts. Zoning data was obtained from the Maryland Department of Assesments and Taxation (SDAT), while demographic data was taken from the American Community Survey (ACS). Data for zoning maps was manipulated in QGIS to obtain estimates for where single-family zoning restrictions were present, and community demographic data was manipulated in R to get estimates for median income, educational attainment, racial populations, etc.
